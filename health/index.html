      <h3 itemprop="headline">CDC gives guidance for trans people ‘chestfeeding’ kids, accused of failing to consider possible health risks</h3>
      <p itemprop="text">




The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s official website published advice for&nbsp;trans and non-binary individuals&nbsp;on seeking guidance on how to "chestfeed" their infants.



In sections of the major health institute’s guidance on breastfeeding, it contained information for those who have had much of their breasts removed in gender-reassignment surgeries, or for biological men taking hormones to grow breasts, on how to feed their newborn children.



However, several doctors criticized the guidance, not simply because CDC has appeared to guide biological men in how to breastfeed children, but because they claimed the CDC has failed to gauge the risks posed to children drinking milk produced by chemicals used in gender-reassignment medical operations.&nbsp;



In the CDC website’s section on "Health Equity Considerations" – found under its "Infant and Young Child Feeding Toolkit," the center declared that "Transgender and nonbinary-gendered individuals may give birth and breastfeed or&nbsp;feed at the chest (chestfeed)."



It also stated that "The gender identity or expression of transgender individuals is different from their sex at birth," and that, "the gender identity of nonbinary-gendered individuals does not fit neatly into either man or woman."



Under the CDC website’s section on "Breast Feeding," specifically an entry covering breastfeeding for those who have undergone breast surgery, the institute mentioned "chestfeeding."



The CDC published advice on how to 'chestfeed' infants as a trans or non-binary individual. 



The CDC posed the question, "Can transgender parents who have had breast surgery breastfeed or chestfeed their infants?" It responded, "yes," followed by an explanation.



"Some transgender parents who have had breast/top surgery may wish to breastfeed, or chestfeed (a term used by some transgender and non-binary parents), their infants" the CDC website states. "Healthcare providers working with these families should be familiar with medical, emotional, and social aspects of gender transitions to provide optimal family-centered care and meet the nutritional needs of the infant."



The post added that these transgender parents "may need help with" "maximizing milk production, supplementing with pasteurized donor human milk or formula, medication to induce lactation or avoiding medications that inhibit lactation, suppressing lactation (for those choosing not to breastfeed or chestfeed)" and "Finding appropriate lactation management support, peer support, and/or emotional support."



Some doctors are criticizing the post because it does not discuss the risks the children could face. 



According to the Daily Mail, this advice may apply to biological men who can produce their own breastmilk by taking "hormone drugs" which mimic the changes that happen to a biological women’s body during the late stage of pregnancy.



However, the outlet noted that the FDA's warning that one of these drugs, domperidone, "can pass into breast milk in small amounts and can sometimes give babies an irregular heartbeat as a result."



The outlet spoke to multiple doctors who criticized&nbsp;the CDC&nbsp;for not mentioning the health risks posed to infants "chest feeding" from biological men transitioning with female-mimicking hormones.&nbsp;



The CDC mentions 'chestfeeding' under the 'breast feeding' section of the website. 



Executive director of the conservative Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, Dr. Jane Orient&nbsp;told The Daily Mail, "The CDC has a responsibility to talk about the health risks, but they have been derelict in doing that."



She also claimed "we have no idea what the long-term effects on the child will be" if trans parents are using "all kinds of off-label hormones," meaning drugs that are being used in a different purpose than for which they were intended.&nbsp;



Dr. Stuart Fischer, a New York-based internal medicine physician, told the Daily Mail that it is "very hard to believe" that the breast milk naturally-occurring in a biological female is the same as the breast milk induced in a biological man.&nbsp;





He is also noted it is uncertain how the latter form of breast milk would affect infants, asking, "If it's been tested a handful of times, how would we know the long-range effect? The short-term is one thing, but the long-term in terms of physical and mental illness..."



"It's an emerging field, to put it mildly," Fischer added.&nbsp;



The CDC didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.&nbsp;

      <h3 itemprop="headline">I thought I was really horny and aggressive — but it was a brain tumor</h3>
      <p itemprop="text">




Shaun Turner was flabbergasted after learning that his sudden onset of "horny and aggressive" behavior was the result of an undiscovered brain tumor. 



"I had personality changes," Turner, 38, said of his seemingly cancer-induced personality shift. 



The UK-based father of two first realized something was awry in 2014 after being beset by a host of unusual symptoms.



The bosun boat boss said he was "really tired all the time, really horny and aggressive," which he found at odds with his typical personality, which is "normally very chilled and easygoing with loads of energy."



Not only that, but Turner started losing his sight and sense of smell. Alarmed, his wife booked an eye test, whereupon the discovery of an anomaly prompted a further scan, which revealed an orange-sized mass on the Brit's brain.



Turner was officially diagnosed with a brain tumor which, along with blindness and other physical effects, can reportedly cause the sufferer to experience a range of demeanor changes.



These include mood swings, aggression and "a loss of inhibitions or restraints and behaving in socially or culturally unacceptable ways," </p>

      <h3 itemprop="headline">Unique yoga experiences: Include goats or puppies, use paddleboards, silk materials and more</h3>
      <p itemprop="text">




Practicing yoga has so many benefits,&nbsp;from improved balance and strength to an increased sense of calmness and positivity.



There isn't just one way to practice yoga.



In most cases, it includes having an open mind and a yoga mat.&nbsp;



And on some occasions, you may not even need a mat.



Whether you are new to yoga, or an experienced yogi looking for something new, here are unique types of yoga to enhance your practice or make it a little more fun.



1. Aerial yoga



Ditch the mat and count on silks.&nbsp;



Aerial yoga&nbsp;is done with the help of silk fabric or ropes. The fabric provides extra support during yoga, making it a fairly low-impact activity.



Using the silks can help with flexibility, stability and balance, while also taking pressure off the body, making more challenging yoga poses a bit easier.



2. Hot yoga



Hot yoga is done in a studio that is 80-100 degrees F. 



Are you ready to sweat? If you aren't afraid of extreme heat, give hot yoga a try. 



Hot yoga makes for a pretty intense workout.&nbsp;



Typically, a&nbsp;hot yoga studio&nbsp;is heated up to a temperature of 80–100 F making for a sweat-filled session.



Count on calories to be burned during hot yoga. 



Beware, though, that when doing hot yoga you're at greater risk of dehydration.&nbsp;



Make sure to properly hydrate before, during and after your session.



Also, if you are pregnant, ask your doctor about practicing hot yoga ahead of time.&nbsp;



If you have any problems with the heat, or any preexisting health conditions that could affect your time in the heated studio, this type of yoga may not be ideal for you.



3. Laughter yoga



Laughter yoga involves a lot of breathing techniques along with clapping and chanting. 



Who doesn't want an excuse to have a good laugh while exercising?&nbsp;



Dr. Madan Kataria in India developed&nbsp;laughter yoga&nbsp;in 1995. &nbsp;



During this type of yoga, there are lots of breathing techniques involved, as well as clapping and chanting.



Laughter yoga, also known as hasya yoga, promotes voluntary laughter and is often done in a group setting. After all, laughing is contagious.



Laughter yoga is known to help with stress relief and also acts as a mood lifter.&nbsp;



4. Dog yoga



Dog yoga was started in 2001 by Suzi Teitelman.



Dog yoga, or doga, is often done at home between a human and his or her pet companion.



This is a practice that Suzi Teitelman started in 2001.



It doesn't just provide physical and mental benefits for you, but also for your furry friend. 



If you're new to this practice, there are many studios you can visit for dog yoga in a group setting.



You can also participate in&nbsp;puppy yoga.



5. Aqua yoga



Aqua yoga is good for improving strength, balance and flexibility. 



Aqua yoga is done in the water. 



While an indoor/outdoor pool is a popular setting for this type of yoga, it can also be practiced in a body of water such as an ocean or lake.&nbsp;



If you are practicing aqua yoga outside, especially in the summer months, don't forget your sunscreen.



This type of yoga is great for both beginners and senior yogis since a lot of the pressure is taken off the body from the water and less mobility is needed to participate.



This low-impact practice includes breathing, poses and meditation while improving strength, flexibility and balance.



6. Goat yoga



Goat yoga is becoming extremely popular after it was created by Lainey Morse in 2016. 



Goat yoga is a relatively new&nbsp;type of yoga, but a rapidly growing one.&nbsp;



If you participate in goat yoga classes, expect adorable goats to join you on your mat.



Sometimes, they'll even hop on top of you while you are holding a pose.



This practice, created by Lainey Morse in 2016, helps&nbsp;reduce stress, anxiety&nbsp;and improves your mood.



This is a very joyful experience for many who participate.



7. Paddleboard yoga



Paddleboard yoga is great for improving balance, since you are balancing on water. 



You won't need a yoga mat for this practice, but you will need a solid paddle board.&nbsp;



This type of yoga can be a bit challenging, but it's great for improving balance.&nbsp;



Paddleboarding yoga is exactly what it sounds like. 



It is yoga that is done in a body of water on a paddleboard.&nbsp;





When choosing the body of water for your yoga experience, try to pick an area with calm waters.



Move into a seated pose, cobra, child's pose, plank and downward-facing dog on your paddleboard.&nbsp;
